java uses camel casing

'class' and 'interface' should start with capital letter

variable and method should start with small letters 

constants - all capital ex- value of 'PIE(3.14)'
// we follow this convention just to make our code much more readable
camel casing
it is used when we combine two or more words together ex- showMyFile
//there is one more convention snake casing in which we use undescore to seperate two words when we are combining two or more words together
//ex- show_my_file however it is not used in java
example
age - variable
MY_DATA - constant
Human() - constructor//why not method because it starts with capital letter
